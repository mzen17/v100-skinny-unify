# Serve Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 on 4x V100 (SM70), k=7 chain-MTP, native NVFP4
# lm_head, fp16 KV cache — the configuration the published numbers were
# measured on.

# Overridable: ENV_PREFIX K GMU MML MNS MBT PORT DECODE_PARTITION THINKING
#
# By default this uses whatever python is first on PATH -- i.e. your active
# conda env. Set ENV_PREFIX to pin a specific environment instead.
#
# The boot is GATED on OBSERVED EXECUTION, not on configuration strings: the
# script refuses to report success unless the server
# actually served the configuration asked for. Five checks, each of which has
# caught a silently-wrong boot at least once:
#
#   1. GPUs must be free first. Booting over an occupied GPU yields a server
#      that runs at a fraction of its speed instead of failing.
#   2. served speculative depth == requested k.
#   3. lm_head is served by the skinny kernel from the checkpoint's OWN
#      NVFP4 codes -- witnessed by a vocab-shaped GEMM routing to qpn.
#      (VLLM_SKINNY_LMHEAD_NATIVE is inert for ModelOpt checkpoints whose
#      lm_head is already quantized in-checkpoint: that flag pulls native
#      codes from a source shard for checkpoints whose head is UNquantized.
#      Gating on its log line would fail every correct boot here.)
#   4. kv_cache_dtype == auto. A ModelOpt checkpoint may declare
#      kv_cache_quant_algo=FP8, which describes how its WEIGHTS were made;
#      honouring it below SM80 loses the tensor-core decode route and costs
#      +4.82 ms/round. The fork declines it — this verifies the decline.
#   5. decode route == qpn (the skinny tensor-core path), not a scalar
#      fallback.
